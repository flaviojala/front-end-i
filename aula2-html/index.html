      <article>
        Children's swimming helps to improve the physical capacity and skills of
        the child, contributing to the evolution of balance, coordination of
        upper and lower limbs and agility. The improvement of motor coordination
        allows the child to move in a more controlled way and exercise their
        strength in a healthy way.

        Children's swimming offers a playful, physical and fun activity for
        children, working various parts of the body without the risk of major
        impacts and without damaging the joints. Even obese children adapt well
        to the sport, as it is lighter compared to exercises such as running and
        volleyball.

      <article>
        The practice of swimming teaches children exercises that help control
        their breathing so that they can swim. These exercises strengthen the
        diaphragm and cardiorespiratory capacity that influences the body's
        oxygenation, in addition to increasing the body's immune resistance.

        Swimming is one of the most useful children's skills. You know those
        holidays when the family goes to the beach or pool? If the child knows
        how to swim, the safety of the ride and the possible prevention of an
        adverse situation is intensified. But be careful, knowing how to swim is
        not a guarantee of safety, it is a prevention. It is important to have
        adult supervision during children's play in any location.

    <h2>What is the best age to start infant swimming?</h2>
    <article>
      According to the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics, it is recommended that
      children start swimming lessons from 6 months of age. It is important to
      emphasize that in children's swimming, the age of the child determines the
      approach during lessons. Below, we separate the 4 phases of children's
      swimming that address different aspects of sports practice for children.
    </article>

    <ul>
      <h3><li>First phase</li></h3>
      <article>
        It is the baby's adaptation to the liquid environment. Going from 6
        months to 2 years, it must be guided so that the child experiences and
        feels the water, mastering body movements and, over time, learn to
        breathe underwater.
      </article>
      <h3><li>Second phase</li></h3>
      <article>
        From 03 to 04 years old, it is the phase in which the child learns to go
        from one point to another. Already with swimming movements, but in a
        “straight line”.
      </article>
      <h3><li>Third phase</li></h3>
      <article>
        Here, children range from 05 to 06 years old. This is the phase in which
        they work on the different styles of swimming, the movement of the arms
        and lateral breathing.
      </article>
      <h3><li>Fourth phase</li></h3>
      <article>
        It is the stage of perfecting swimming styles, for example, backstroke,
        butterfly etc. Here, it covers children from 7 to 12 years old.
